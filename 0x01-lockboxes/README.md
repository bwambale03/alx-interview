# Lockboxes Project

This project explores a scenario where you need to determine if all boxes in a series can be unlocked. Each box contains keys that can open other boxes.

## Project Structure

- **`0-lockboxes.py`**: Implements the `canUnlockAll` function that checks if all boxes can be unlocked.
- **`main_0.py`**: Script with test cases to validate the `canUnlockAll` function.
- **`__pycache__`**: Directory for Python bytecode cache files.

## How to Run

To test the functionality, run the following command:

```bash
./main_0.py
